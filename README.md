# marketing-Overview

## Introduction

Marketers today must be sharp and strategic in order to reach their target audience in a digital and competitive environment. Currently, our campaign response rates are languishing below 10%, which means wasted marketing budgets, low customer engagement, and revenue opportunities lost. This situation represents a challenge as well as a huge opportunity. If we can take on this challenge in an anticipatory manner, we can transform it into an opportunity to generate meaningful business growth. Our overall plan is to improve performance through data driven campaign management. Our immediate goal is to increase response rates by at least 15%. 

## Initial analysis identified important customer segments showing promise
â€¢	26.04% of customers placed an order in the past 30 days 

â€¢	 1170 customers had above-average website visitation rates per month

â€¢	970 customers exhibited a high level of in-store purchasing 

â€¢	 334 accepted campaign 6

â€¢	233 customers high-value & loyal customers (indicating we can add an estimated 28 customers with targeted campaigns) By optimizing targeting approaches, we will generate higher campaign performance and ROI.

## Current Challenges

1.Low Engagement (less than 10%)  :  Our campaigns are not resonating with the appropriate audience.

2.Ineffective Targeting :No more broad based outreach that incurs wasted marketing spend.

3.Low Customer Engagement :Lack of personalization translates to lower overall conversions.

4.Lost High Value Opportunities :Underutilization of key segments (high-consuming, frequent buyers) is commonplace.

## Insights

â€¢ Customers accepted campaign 6 more than any other campaign

â€¢ 724 Customers made order in the last 30days 

â€¢ Average income 52,247 

â€¢ 1084 customer has income above average 

â€¢  1170 customers visited the web in the last 30days

â€¢ 970 customers visited the store in the last 30days

â€¢ 87 customers accepted campaign 6 and more

### ðŸ“Š **Campaign Response Strategy Using RFM Analysis**

To drive at least a 15% increase in acceptance for the upcoming marketing campaign, I conducted an RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis. This method allowed me to segment the customer base into four key categories:

- **Priority Customers**-â€“ 87 customers who accepted Campaign 6 and at least one other campaign
  
- **High Value Customers**
  
- **Loyal Customers**
  
- **Average Customers**
  
From this segmentation, 334 customers who responded to Campaign 6 were identified. These individuals are likely to engage again in the upcoming campaign based on prior behavior.

To boost the projected response rate, I also identified additional high-potential customers by applying the following criteria:
- **Recent purchase within the last 30 days**
- **Income greater than $90,000**
  
This led to the identification of 28 more customers, increasing the total pool to 362 customers (334 + 28). The inclusion of these potential responders is expected to result in a projected response rate of 16.2%, surpassing the initial goal of 15%.

### **Recommendations**

1.**Prioritize Priority Customers in Campaign Messaging**

Focus personalized and value-driven messages on the 87 Priority Customers, as they have demonstrated consistent engagement across multiple campaigns.

2.**Adopt the Expanded Targeting Strategy**

Target the full pool of 362 customers, combining past responders and new high-potential prospects, to optimize campaign reach and conversion.

3.**Monitor Campaign Performance in Real-Time**

Use campaign dashboards to track response rates, customer interactions, and conversion metrics to validate the segmentation approach.

4.**Regularly Refresh RFM Segmentation**

Update the RFM model periodically to reflect evolving customer behavior and improve predictive accuracy.


---

###  **Conclusion**
RFM analysis with behavior has successfully segmented the customer base for a more tailored approach to campaign strategy optimization. The segmentation discovered gives a distinct advantage to help strengthen brand loyalty through Priority Customers. The next campaign is expected to surpass the goal of a 15% response rate by attaining 16.2%. This is possible by targeting the combined group of 362 customers which includes Priority Customers and newly identified high potential prospects. With effective handling and monitoring of the strategyâ€™s execution, there will be improved campaign performance and customer interaction.
