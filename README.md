# marketing-Overview

## Introduction

Marketers today must be sharp and strategic in order to reach their target audience in a digital and competitive environment. Currently, our campaign response rates are languishing below 10%, which means wasted marketing budgets, low customer engagement, and revenue opportunities lost. This situation represents a challenge as well as a huge opportunity. If we can take on this challenge in an anticipatory manner, we can transform it into an opportunity to generate meaningful business growth. Our overall plan is to improve performance through data driven campaign management. Our immediate goal is to increase response rates by at least 15%. 

## Initial analysis identified important customer segments showing promise
â€¢	26.04% of customers placed an order in the past 30 days 

â€¢	 1170 customers had above-average website visitation rates per month

â€¢	970 customers exhibited a high level of in-store purchasing 

â€¢	 334 accepted campaign 6

â€¢	233 customers high-value & loyal customers (indicating we can add an estimated 28 customers with targeted campaigns) By optimizing targeting approaches, we will generate higher campaign performance and ROI.

## Current Challenges

1.Low Engagement (less than 10%)  :  Our campaigns are not resonating with the appropriate audience.

2.Ineffective Targeting :No more broad based outreach that incurs wasted marketing spend.

3.Low Customer Engagement :Lack of personalization translates to lower overall conversions.

4.Lost High Value Opportunities :Underutilization of key segments (high-consuming, frequent buyers) is commonplace.

## Insights

â€¢ Customers accepted campaign 6 more than any other campaign

â€¢ 724 Customers made order in the last 30days 

â€¢ Average income 52,247 

â€¢ 1084 customer has income above average 

â€¢  1170 customers visited the web in the last 30days

â€¢ 970 customers visited the store in the last 30days

â€¢ 87 customers accepted campaign 6 and more

### ðŸ“Š **Campaign Response Strategy Using RFM Analysis**

To achieve at least a 15% increase in acceptance for the upcoming marketing campaign, I conducted an RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis. This allowed me to segment the customer base into three key categories:

- **High Value Customers**  
- **Loyal Customers**  
- **Average Customers**

From this analysis, 334 customers who responded positively to **Campaign 6** were identified. These customers are likely to accept future campaigns due to their past engagement.

To build on this base and further increase the response rate, I filtered additional potential customers based on the following criteria:
- **Recent purchase within the last 30 days**
- **Income greater than $90,000**

This approach identified **28 new customers** who are likely to engage. Adding these to the 334 gives a total of **362 targeted customers**, which could result in a projected **16.2% response rate**exceeding the 15% goal.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Recommendations**

1. **Adopt the Enhanced Targeting Strategy**  
   Launch the upcoming campaign to the 362 selected customers those identified from Campaign 6 and the newly added segment to boost response outcomes.

2. **Track Campaign Performance**  
   Monitor the engagement levels closely to validate the assumptions made in the analysis and gather insights for future segmentation.

3. **Update RFM Analysis Regularly**  
   Regular re-segmentation will make certain that strategic marketing activities are framed in accordance with the observed customer behavior and prevailing economic environment.


---

### âœ… **Conclusion**
Employing RFM analysis captured high probability responders for the subsequent campaign without issue. Considering all previously responsive customers and the newly responsive customers based on recency and income, the campaign is set to hit a **16.2% expected response rate**, surpassing the initial estimate of 15%. If the outlined strategy is placed under close observation, it will assist in succeeding future marketing endeavors.
